## Component Initialization

To initialize control of a board, construct an instance of the `Board` class.


> When connecting to a USB serial device, such as an Arduino, you **do not** need to specify the device path or COM port, Johnny-Five will determine which to connect to and connect automatically.

```js
new five.Board();
```

<
er>You may optionally specify the port by providing it as a property of the options object parameter.</center>

```js
// OSX
new five.Board({ port: "/dev/tty.usbmodem****" });

// Linux
new five.Board({ port: "/dev/ttyUSB*" });

// Windows
new five.Board({ port: "COM*" });
```

\* Denotes system specific enumeration value (ie. a number)

You can specify a `SerialPort` object by providing it as a property of the options object parameter:

```js
var SerialPort = require("serialport").SerialPort;
var five = require("johnny-five");
var board = new five.Board({
  port: new SerialPort("COM4", {
    baudrate: 9600,
    buffersize: 1
  })
});
```



## Usage

<center>A basic, but complete example usage of the `Board` constructor:</center>


```js
var five = require("johnny-five");
var board = new five.Board();

board.on("ready", function() {
  /*
    Initialize pin 13, which 
    controls the built-in LED
  */
  var led = new five.Led(13);

  /*
    Injecting object into the REPL
    allow access while the program
    is running. 

    Try these in the REPL: 

    led.on();
    led.off();
    led.blink();

    (One at a time to see each action)
  */
  this.repl.inject({
    led: led
  });
});
```


## Sub-process Usage

When running Johnny-Five programs as a sub-process (eg. init.d, or npm scripts), be sure to shut the REPL off!


```js
var five = require("johnny-five");
var board = new five.Board({
  repl: false,
  debug: false,
});

board.on("ready", function() {
  // it's very quiet in here now!
});
```



## API


### Logging

- **info(class, message [, ...detail])** Displays an _info_ message in the console (when `debug: true`, which is the default) and emits an event of the same name, as well as a generic _message_ event. `class` is the class that triggered the message, or that is being reported for; `message` is any relevant message. This argument accept an arbitrary number of _detail_ arguments. If the last _detail_ argument is an object or array, it will be passed along as the value of a `data` property of the event object.
  ```js
  board.info("Board", "I got somethin' to say!", { foo: 1 });

  board.info("Servo", "This pin doesn't have hardware PWM support, but will function correctly with software Servo support.");
  ```

- **warn(class, message [, ...detail])** Displays a _warn_ message in the console (when `debug: true`, which is the default) and emits an event of the same name, as well as a generic _message_ event. `class` is the class that triggered the message, or that is being reported for; `message` is any relevant message. This argument accept an arbitrary number of _detail_ arguments. If the last _detail_ argument is an object or array, it will be passed along as the value of a `data` property of the event object.
  ```js
  board.warn("Board", "Watch out!", { bar: 2 });
  ```

- **fail(class, message [, ...detail])** Displays a _fail_ message in the console (when `debug: true`, which is the default) and emits an event of the same name, as well as a generic _message_ event. `class` is the class that triggered the message, or that is being reported for; `message` is any relevant message. This argument accept an arbitrary number of _detail_ arguments. If the last _detail_ argument is an object or array, it will be passed along as the value of a `data` property of the event object.
  ```js
  board.fail("Led", "This pin is already in use!", { baz: NaN });

  board.fail("Board", "This program attempted to do something that isn't possible");  
  ```

See [Events](#events) for specific log event details.


- **repl** This is a reference to the active REPL automatically created by the `Board` class. This object has an `inject` method that may be called as many times as desired:
  - **repl.inject(object)** Inject objects or values, from the program, into the REPL session.

    ```js
    var five = require("johnny-five");
    var board = new five.Board();

    board.on("ready", function() {
      // Initialize an LED directly in the REPL
      this.repl.inject({
        led: new five.Led(13)
      });  
    });
    /*
      From the terminal...

      $ node program.js
      1423012815316 Device(s) /dev/cu.usbmodem1421
      1423012818908 Connected /dev/cu.usbmodem1421
      1423012818908 Repl Initialized  
      >> led.on();
      >> led.off();

    */
    ```

- **pinMode(pin, mode)** Set the `mode` of a specific `pin`, one of INPUT, OUTPUT, ANALOG, PWM, SERVO. Mode constants are exposed via the `Pin` class

  | Mode   | Value | Constant   |
  | ------ | ----- | ---------- |
  | INPUT  | 0     | Pin.INPUT  |
  | OUTPUT | 1     | Pin.OUTPUT |
  | ANALOG | 2     | Pin.ANALOG |
  | PWM    | 3     | Pin.PWM    |
  | SERVO  | 4     | Pin.SERVO  |

  ```js
  // Set a pin to INPUT mode
  var five = require("johnny-five");
  var board = new five.Board();

  board.on("ready", function() {

    // pin mode constants are available on the Pin class
    this.pinMode(13, five.Pin.INPUT);
  });
  ```

- **analogWrite(pin, value)** Write an unsigned, 8-bit value (0-255) to an analog `pin`.
  ```js
  var five = require("johnny-five");
  var board = new five.Board();

  board.on("ready", function() {
    // Assuming an Led is attached to pin 9, 
    // this will turn it on at full brightness
    // PWM is the mode used to write ANALOG 
    // signals to a digital pin
    this.pinMode(9, five.Pin.PWM);
    this.analogWrite(9, 255);
  });
  ```

- **analogRead(pin, handler(voltage))** Register a handler to be called whenever the board reports the voltage value (0-1023) of the specified analog `pin`.
  ```js
  var five = require("johnny-five");
  var board = new five.Board();

  board.on("ready", function() {
    // Assuming a sensor is attached to pin "A1"
    this.pinMode(1, five.Pin.ANALOG);
    this.analogRead(1, function(voltage) {
      console.log(voltage);
    });
  });
  ```

- **digitalWrite(pin, value)** Write a digital value (0 or 1) to a digital `pin`.
  ```js
  var five = require("johnny-five");
  var board = new five.Board();

  board.on("ready", function() {
    // Assuming an Led is attached to pin 13, this will turn it on
    this.pinMode(13, five.Pin.OUTPUT);
    this.digitalWrite(13, 1);
  });
  ```

- **digitalRead(pin, handler(value))** Register a `handler` to be called whenever the board reports the value (0 or 1) of the specified digital `pin`.
  ```js
  var five = require("johnny-five");
  var board = new five.Board();

  board.on("ready", function() {
    // Assuming a button is attached to pin 9
    this.pinMode(9, five.Pin.INPUT);
    this.digitalRead(9, function(value) {
      console.log(value);
    });
  });
  ```

  > Note: `digitalRead` will only call its handler when the value of the pin **changes**.


- **i2cConfig([milliseconds] | options)** This must be called prior to any I2C reads or writes.
  - May be called with a period in milliseconds to delay between read operations.
  - May be called with an object containing options relevant to the platform for which the code is being written. For more information, see: [IO-Plugins, i2cConfig(options)](https://github.com/rwaldron/io-plugins#i2cconfigoptions)

    this.loop(500, () => {
      this.digitalWrite(13, (state ^= 1));
    });
  });
  ```

## Events

- **connect** This event will emit once the program has "connected" to the board. This may be immediate, or after some amount of time, but is always asynchronous. For on-board execution, `connect` should emit as soon as possible, but asynchronously.

- **ready** This event will emit _after_ the **connect** event and only when the `Board` instance object has completed any hardware initialization that must take place before the program can operate. This process is asynchronous, and completion is signified to the program via a "ready" event. For on-board execution, `ready` should emit after `connect`.

- **exit** This event is emitted synchronously on `SIGINT`. Use this handler to do any necessary cleanup before your program is "disconnected" from the board.

- **close** This event is emmited when the device does not respond. Can be used to detect if board gets disconnected.

- **info** This event will emit for `board.info(class, message [, ...])`
  ```js
  board.on("info", function(event) {
    /*
      Event {
        type: "info"|"warn"|"fail",
        timestamp: Time of event in milliseconds,
        class: name of relevant component class,
        message: message [+ ...detail]
      }
    */
    console.log("%s sent an 'info' message: %s", event.class, event.message);
  });
  ```

- **warn** This event will emit for `board.warn(class, message [, ...])`
  ```js
  board.on("warn", function(event) {
    /*
      Event {
        type: "info"|"warn"|"fail",
        timestamp: Time of event in milliseconds,
        class: name of relevant component class,
        message: message [+ ...detail]
      }
    */
    console.log("%s sent a 'warn' message: %s", event.class, event.message);
  });
  ```

- **fail** This event will emit for `board.fail(class, message [, ...])`
  ```js
  board.on("fail", function(event) {
    /*
      Event {
        type: "info"|"warn"|"fail",
        timestamp: Time of event in milliseconds,
        class: name of relevant component class,
        message: message [+ ...detail]
      }
    */
    console.log("%s sent a 'fail' message: %s", event.class, event.message);
  });
  ```

- **message** This event will emit for any logging message: `info`, `warn` or `fail`.
  ```js
  board.on("message", function(event) {
    /*
      Event {
        type: "info"|"warn"|"fail",
        timestamp: Time of event in milliseconds,
        class: name of relevant component class,
        message: message [+ ...detail]
      }
    */
    console.log("Received a %s message, from %s, reporting: %s", event.type, event.class, event.message);
  });
  ```
