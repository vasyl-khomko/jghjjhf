====

slap is a Sublime-like terminal-based text editor that strives to make editing from the terminal easier. It has:

* first-class mouse support (even over an SSH connection)
* a Sublime-like file sidebar
* double-click to select word, highlight other occurrences
* configurable Sublime-like [keybindings](#default-keybindings)[*](#some-keys-dont-work) (<kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> save, <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd> undo, etc.)
* copying/pasting with OS clipboard support
* infinite undo/redo
* syntax highlighting for [100+ languages](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/tree/master/src/languages)
* bracket matching
* autoindentation
* heavily customizeable via [plugins](#plugins)
* ... many other features that will make you leave nano, vim, and emacs behind

### Configuration

slap supports INI or JSON config files. You can put configuration [wherever rc can find it](https://github.com/dominictarr/rc#standards). A mostly empty configuration file with some useful comments is created in [`~/.slap/config`](default-config.ini) if an existing file isn't found.

Pass configuration via command line:

    $ slap --header.style.bg red file.c

### Plugins

Slap is fully customizeable and supports plugins written in JS. You can place single JS files, or NodeJS packages, into `~/.slap/plugins/`.

To write your own plugin, a good starting point is [slap-clipboard-plugin](https://github.com/slap-editor/slap-clipboard-plugin). Please note that plugin packages must have `"keywords": ["slap-plugin"]` in `package.json`.

OS support
----------

### OSX

iTerm2 supports the mouse and most keybindings out of the box. For optimal Terminal.app usage, see [slap-Terminal.app-profile](https://github.com/slap-editor/slap-Terminal.app-profile).

### Linux

If you are using X.Org, ensure xclip is installed for OS clipboard support.

### Windows

Most terminal emulators in Windows do not support mouse events, PuTTY being a notable exception. In Cygwin, slap crashes on startup due to [joyent/node#6459](https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/6459).

Join us in [#slap on Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=slap) for troubleshooting, theme/plugin/core development, or palm strike discussion of any nature.

### Some keys don't work!

*NOTE: if you are using Terminal.app, see [slap-Terminal.app-profile](https://github.com/slap-editor/slap-Terminal.app-profile).*

Unfortunately most terminal emulators do not support certain keystrokes and as such there is no way to handle them. These include `C-backspace`, `S-home/end`, and `S-pageup/down`. Most of these actions have alternate keybindings, inspired by emacs and other editors, but if you find one that doesn't work, please [submit an issue](../../issues/new)!

### Slow on single cores, Raspberry Pi

slap is based on Github's [atom/text-buffer](https://github.com/atom/text-buffer), and as such should be very performant, even with very large files.

Try `--editor.highlight false` or adding the following to `~/.slap/config`:

    [editor]
    highlight = false

If that doesn't improve performance, please run with `--perf.profile true` and [submit an issue](../../issues/new) with the newly-created `v8.log` file.
